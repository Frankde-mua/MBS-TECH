# React Dashboard Template

Quick starter React project (Vite) with a single-page dashboard that includes:
- Reports page (charts & metrics)
- Calendar page (month view + agenda)
- Billing page (quick service selector and summary)

**How to run**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This project uses the Tailwind CDN in `public/index.html` for quick styling (no tailwind setup required).
